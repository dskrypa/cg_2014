==============================

Camera movement:
X/Y/Z key press = move camera in positive X/Y/Z direction; lower case = negative
Holding a mouse button and dragging the mouse will spin the camera around its
focal point; the direction that each button allows movement in isn't easy to
explain.

I know it is not complete... I have honestly spent days working on this, but I
repeatedly ran into issues that were difficult for me to get through.  I was
having problems with simply getting things to display that I had not run into
before, so ran out of time to properly test and refine animal movement.
I probably spent too much time trying to get the camera to move in a way that I
was satisfied with, which also cut into the time that I was able to spend on the
animals.  I will continue working on this over the next couple of days and I
will email you the revised version, if you're willing to accept it.
